# my-first-codes


Owner: Sarina Fakour  
These are my very first cpp codes in GitHub.

Here the projects are categorized into separate folders.
We have 6 categories in which, the projects related to that will be stored.
The categories are as follows:
* Introduction
* Decisions and Loops
* Functions
* Arrays and Strings
* Structures
* Operator Overloading

Each folder contains a bunch of small projects with a README.md file 
which explains the project.

Please add a new cpp code into each sub-folder and push the solution 
for the problem explained in the README.md file there.
