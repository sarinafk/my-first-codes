In this example, you will learn to find ASCII value of a character in C++.

A character variable holds ASCII value (an integer number between 0 and 127) rather than that character itself in C programming. That value is known as ASCII value.

For example, ASCII value of 'A' is 65.

What this means is that, if you assign 'A' to a character variable, 65 is stored in that variable rather than 'A' itself.
